The only other major side effect has been frequent bleeding and much heavier periods than usual.  I normally have a fairly light, short period (2 days normal bleeding, 1-2 of spotting). But there have been two occasions since starting Lyza in which I have woken up in a pool of blood on the bed because the bleeding is so heavy and unexpected. There has been some bloating as well, but I'm not sure if that is due to the pill because I had the same issue with Mirena. I have my suspicions about ovarian cysts, so that could be causing the bloating, breast tenderness, and abnormal bleeding. I rated ease of use as one star because it has been very difficult for me to remember to take the pill on time even though I set an alarm on my phone.

I'm not on birth control (but i should be) because i dont want my mother to think that im having sex etc. So i went to las vegas and for the first four days i was there i didnt get my period (thank god) and the fifth day i got it and took the pills that morning afternoon and night for the first few days of my period hoping that it would have some effect. Well, it didn't. I was so pissed off because i get terrible periods where i can't get out of bed and i'm really not a nice person and highly emotional and it's just not a good time for me.

Ruining clothing, sleeping with a towel in the bed, cramping severly with large blood clots. Birthcontrol pills had the reverse effect on me causing me to bleed 3 weeks on and 1 week off. So no good. Finally, years later a doctor finally recognized the help I needed and suggested Lysteda and I love it. Now I only use 1 package of pads with some left over. My life is on again. I can enjoy outings with my husband and children without panic of changing a pad and tampon within 30 minutes. The only side effects I have using the pills are: dry mouth and headaches with a hot feeling in my stomach at times. So I have to increase my water intake, drink gatorade and keep the ceiling fan going at night so I don't sweat while taking it. Overall, Lysteda works for me.

What was unusual was I felt a contraction type feeling the 3rd morning after I took the Lysteda that lasted about a 1/2 hour. The contraction feeling was not painful, just freaky. No other unusual side effects noted at this time. The number of days on cycle were as usual. My flow was reduced by 50% or more. I was not tied to a bathroom like I usually am on days 2-5! I messed up on the dosage the first day and only took one 650mg tablet in the morning and afternoon. Taking only one had reduced it some (like 20%) but not as much as it did once I got my actual prescription and noticed I needed to take two 650mg tablets, three times a day. My doctor prescribed it correctly, I had forgotten how many she said. It seemed like it would be a lot to remember taking the meds at first, but if someone has a vested interest such as I, you don't forget...believe me! I did start the meds on day 2 and stopped at bedtime on day 5, my doctor says however I should start taking them on day 1. I am not a big fan of taking medication for anything, but I recommend Lysteda because it was very freeing. I will try to remember to post updates after continued usage, especially if I develop side-effects. I've found the reviews of others very helpful to me.  

Note for medical professionals: A strange occurance that may be linked to the contraction type feeling on morning 3. I had two ultra sounds. One about a week after my last period ended and one two days after this past period ended (lysteda usage) and the technician told me my uterus was significantly smaller in size.

I am 35, have 2 kids, and have tried some of the hormonal BC pills, rings, etcâ€¦ but they have all had adverse effects on me, so I wont use them anymore.  Normally my periods are 7 full days of bleeding.  Days 2-4 I usually wore heavy/overnight pads & super size tampon that I had to change almost every hour around the clock, or I would risk bleeding through everything in sight.  My period this month was due when I was on vacation (of course!), so it showed up the moment we got to our destination.  Using Lysteda, I was able to enjoy myself- swimming, sports activities, sleeping comfortably- w/o being paranoid about where the nearest bathroom was and w/o wondering if I was going to feel a mortifying gush of blood at any moments notice.  It does not stop bleeding all together, but I would say I had a 50% or more decrease.  I used probably 1/4 the number of tampons & pads I usually would.  Taking the pills was not a problem, and after day 5, when you stop taking them, my period just abruptly ended.  I had no noticeable side effects.  I am interested to see if my period will get even more tolerable as I continue taking the pills.  Worth a try in my opinion if your period incapacitates you every month like mine did!

19-24,Neuropathic Pain,12-08-2019,lyrica,93965,1,3,"After being on Lyrica (pregabalin) for over two years, I've experienced the positive effects that many report, but also the terrible side effects and dependency.  Lyrica decreased my sensitivity and pain, but only in the beginning.  In my experience, it is a drug that your body builds a tolerance to after some time (for me approx 2-3 weeks in which you get the positive effects), however after this period positive effects wear off as your body has built a tolerance, prompting the GP/Pain specialist to increase the dosage beginning a cycle of increasing dosages and built tolerance.  
I got up to 250mg without doctors giving me any warnings of the increased risk of side effects.  Besides weight gain, there is a risk of memory and concentration loss, very real and debilitating effects that were not advertised to me.  Upon realising that these side effects were greatly impacting my life (would forget where I was and what day it was), my GP advised me to decrease the dosage slowly.  Lyrica had made my body so dependent on the drug that decreasing caused major withdrawal effects, as if I was coming off some kind of illicit drug (cold sweats, trembling, migraine, nausea and increased pain to the extent that moving was rarely possible).  I am still on Lyrica and have gone through another withdrawal episode, however am now on 150mg.  I strongly suggest that anyone going on the drug carefully consider the effects.  If your doctor has no concerns that over a year your pain is still increasing despite increasing the dosage and they have no other plans of treatment, get a new doctor!  Don't get to the stage where you can't maintain a reasonable dose and become stuck and dependent on the drug while experiencing potentially detrimental side effects.  There are many other drugs and therapies out there for pain which may better help your condition.",1,Female,"Drowsiness,  dizziness ,  dry mouth ,  constipation , difficulty concentrating, or  weight  gain may occur.",14

I weaned myself off the ones that caused side effects when quitting but I did it. The only time I Took anything for pain is when it got so bad I couldn't function. This was all before this recent damage to my lower back. I have had to quit work, I can no longer go for long walks let alone run, as I was a runner and always moving doing some sort of activity.

She upped my dose to 150 twice aday. That helped a lot but still u able to do anything. So back to doc and gave me Naproxen 1000 once aday. That helped tremendously. I can now walk and do things although nothing strenuous. Any lifting I could feel the pinching of the nerve. Still unable to do much of anything. Think my injury is too bad to have a really good reaction to the Lyrica. I have been on it for about 2 months.

Docs first put me on gabapentin (neurontin) which only reduced my pain for about an hour a day.  I finally went back and they said oh, let's try you on Lyrica (insurances require you trying neurontin first).  Bingo! Pain Relief!!   It gives about 75% of pain relief - slightly more on a good day; less on a bad day.   Of course since the affected nerve trunk for me was the main torso, right along the bra line, if I wear a bra forget it, nothing helps - YEOWW,  OUCH.   

The main problem with Lyrica is that it turned my brain to mush.  No short-term memory, transposing letters and numbers (and I was an editor, never transposed a thing in my life), forgetfulness.  I can no longer have meaningful employment as I can't remember directions or instructions from one minute to the next. You should see me make coffee in the morning! Who knew there were so many steps to forget? (filter, coffee, water, oh and don't forget to put the pot in the coffeemaker! I have forgotten all steps at some point).  

I often forget to take my med unless reminded by my spouse and if I forget, the pain comes back with a vengance and that sure reminds me!  I would rather not be on Lyrica, and periodically get tired of being such an airhead and try to reduce it, but the PAIN is unliveable and reminds me of my choices.

I wish I'd never had shingles and had my nerve trunk damaged.  Everybody out there, GET THE VACCINE!!  But since I did and I can't change that, I am so so so grateful for Lyrica.  ANd I can't wait for the 7 years to be up so I can get the generic.  With insurance it's $50/month, without is about $250 I think.

My Urologist has had success with using Lyrica for patients with prostate pain that weren't aided by other treatments.  Since this is a drug related to Neurontin it seemed logical to try this rather than adding a totally different drug to my already long list of pills.  

At 75mg twice a day I didn't notice a change from the Neurontin.  After a few days at 150mg twice a day Lyrica improved my overall pain control and started to make a slight difference with the prostate pain.  I am confident the next increase will do more to help.

Lyrica has helped my overall body pain a great deal, though during flare-ups, it doesn't seem to help at all (NOTHING helps my flare-ups).  I attempted to stop taking Lyrica 3 times now, but I always return to taking it, as my pain is more severe when not on it.  Have come to the conclusion that I need to take Lyrica for better quality of life.  The downside is weight gain of 40 pounds (good thing I was only 110 pounds to begin with)!!!!! My other medications also cause weight gain and the fact that I just turned 40 and am much less active now due to the pain & fatigue from fibro. also contribute to the weight issue.  I am NOT happy about being 150 pounds @ only 5'4"" tall.  Also, I feel spaced-out and like I'm floating on air most of the time on Lyrica.  My assessment of Lyrica:  Very helpful with overall fibro. pain but with annoying side effects.  Overall, for me, the benefit of pain relief is more important to me than the side effects of spaciness and weight gain.  I guess it's better to be fat and in less pain than skinny and miserable!

I was put on Lycria for Nerve damage in my spine and neck along with inflammatory conditions.  It worked great for about 5 months but I was always druged up. I took the lowest dosage available.  It stopped working after 6 months, and the pain got worse. I gained 30 lbs and had no fear of any body any where.  My kids begged me to get rid of pills, so I dumped then in the toilet.  I suffered day after day, night after night, drugs scare me.  Recently, I went to another pain clinic and was put on Ultram (generic name Tramadol).  I cut them in half and have started on 25mg, I was a little dizzy for about 40 min, then I felt fine in fact it took about 30% of the pain away immediatly.  I might sleep like a baby for the first time in over a year.

It is my opinion that Lycria is a bad drug and highly addictive regardless of what the doctors tell you.  Be cautious taking this drug.  When coming off of this drug, you may experience severe depression and have anxiety attacks, it happened to me.  I cried 12 hours out each day, and walked around with swollen eyes.

Started on 75mg x2/day and went up to 150mg x2/day. Didn't really get any pain relief, just made me very, very tired and lethargic. I needed like 10-12 hrs sleep & often had to lie down in the daytime too! It was very unpleasant. Had no energy and sometimes I couldn't even move! Horrible. Ineffective for me, but it obviously works for some people. TIP: If price is an issue for you but it works, try gabapentin (Neurontin I think is the trade name) instead. They are closely related and gabapentin has been around longer so is available as a generic and hence cheaper! My back pain hasn't gone away and I'm now on Oxycodone, which is a proper painkiller! But even that only takes the edge off. I've learned pain management techniques & now get by with oxycodone and Valium plus heat packs, relaxation, pain support groups, changing positions regularly, massage and self-healing meditations.

No drug has ever made me feel that way before--ever!*** So, I stopped taking the Lyrica. I slept for two days straight..(over 44 hours of 48) I got up to go to the bathroom, drink some water and literally stumble back into bed. On the third day, I woke up feeling less dizzy and more normal. Weirdly--my pain level was still down, but it came back more and more each day.

Ever since I have taken hydrocodone, Enbrel, Vioxx(wish this was still available), celebrex, azulfadine, ultram, mobic, etodolac, cymbalta, and more.
CURRENT - My pain for the last 2 1/2 years or so has been centered around my lower back and radiates out and down my right leg most of the time.  Sometimes my left leg as well.  Over the last 3 years or so I have had about 8 epidural steriod injections, 4 or 5 rhizotomies(kind of helped) and keep trying new medications.  Oh I have a tens unit also.  It seems to help a little.  
LYRICA - I was prescribed lyrica about 6 months ago.  I take 3 100mg per day.  It really eased the pain in my legs and some in my lower back.  Most of my pain now is centered right around the mid-lower back and into my right hip.  I haven't had any negative reactions that I know of.

I've been diagnosed with Fibromialgia, as well as the usual degenerative disc disease, and more.   I've been on every medication that comes out but tend to have bad reactions to many of them.  Unfortunately Lyrica appears to be no different.  I initially tried it in April 2008 and ended up in the hospital for a week within a couple of weeks of taking the med.  Due to being on other medications, having chronic pain and nerve issues, etc., the doctors did not associate my illness with the Lyrica directly but did have me go off it while in the hospital since it was a new medication.  I was having strange and scary symptoms (such as: blood red and purple dots covering both legs, urinary infection with bloody tissue in urine, swollen neck and face, nausea, pain throughout body, dangerously low platelets and white blood cell count, etc.). I actually got worse before I eventually began to get better on my own and was released from the hospital. Every test imaginable was done without a clear diagnosis. The doctors eventually said I had an allergic reaction to the sulfate drug they had put me on for the urinary infection and had some unknown virus at the same time.  So my family physician re-prescribed the Lyrica this month (Oct. 2008) to try it again. Last night was my first attempt and I immediately had a terrible reaction (swollen face, neck, legs, & ankles; dizziness, confusion, extreme thirst, problems urinating). This caused me to read through most of the reviews on this site. I discovered that many people have had similar negative reactions that I had both months ago (that caused me to be hospitalized) & the reactions from last night.  Please be very careful taking this drug. It appears to work with little to no side effects for some but severe side effects for others, like me. I'm very disappointed but hope another solution will eventually work for me.

Over the last 10 years, I have exhausted all courses of treatment for my condition (acupuncture, physical therapy, chiropractic, heat, ice, tens unit, stretching, exercises, NSAIDS, Cox-2 Inhibitors, Pamelor, Tramadol, Ultram XR cervical epidurals, etc...) to no good effect.  The only thing that relived my pain was hydrocodone 10/325, 2 pills every 4 hours, 8 pills per day.  I took hydrocodone for 1 year, developed a tolerance and was titrated off.  I started Lyrica 6 days ago - 1 75mg capsule 2x/day.  On day 3, I increased dosing to 1 75mg cap 3x/day.
Days 1 through 5 I had mild side effects of light-headedness and drowsiness that did not keep me from my daily activities - working, driving, etc. Today, day 6, I have no side effects whatsoever.  I experienced significant pain relief from day 1, which may or may not have been due to transitioning from Neurontin (which didn't ease my pain at all) to Lyrica.  I had high hopes for this drug, and so far, my hopes have been realized.  My only concern is that the drug is so new (approved for the US in mid 2005), that there is not a lot of anecdotal evidence for it.  Hopefully it won't turn out to be another Rezulin or Vioxx.

I immediately went off if it. Then a year later was asked to try it again with this time slowly working up to the 150 mg dose. This helped a lot because I didn't get the nausea or shakiness, but like the first time, I got the toe blistering and now around the nails on my fingers as well. I felt my vision which had improved once I was off the drug, was now getting blurrier again, and my brain seemed to be less coherent than when not on the drug.

Thankfully he gave me a sample bottle first! I pay out of pocket with my high deductible insurance and it was going to be $200+ per month. I took Lyrica 75mg at bedtime for 6 nights. By day one I did feel improvement in muscle lumps but my arthritic joints felt worse. But the worst part was I felt very dizzy and loopy, could not concentrate, SO tired. I thought it would get better but it did not. After 6 nights/7days I had done nothing all week, no errands, no chores, plus had lost an entire day that I don't remember. That's ok for someone who wants to just lay around all day but I have acres of animals to care for and other responsibilities, I do not wish to be drunk every day and unable to function. Oh, I also gained 4 lbs that week, most likely water. So I stopped taking it all together since there was NO way I was going to get up to the 225mg doc wanted. Now today, 3 wks later my pain doc (he referred me to the Rheumatologist who RX'd the Lyrica)said my side effects are quite common and he's RX'd me Neurontin to try.

It has greatly helped my chronic neurological pain--no burning, no pinching, no numbness, no horrible, earth shattering pain. A huge help. Instead of it making me feel sleepy,  it makes me feel like I'm racing and focused--sort of like the way adderal feels. No tiredness, no lack of concentration. 

I have two issues, however, with Lyrica. The first is weight gain--I have NEVER gained weight like this before. 20 to 30 pounds that I haven't been able to drop, even with a juice cleanse. I've never eaten particularly well, but this is ridiculous. It comes off fast and feels almost impossible to lose. You really have to weigh which is more important to you. The second issue is what doctors call ""discontinuation withdrawal,"" which is a fancy term for addiction. I am dependent on Lyrica. I take it every morning, and if I miss the dose, a few hours later I'm entering full on drug withdrawal. Chills, aches, stomach sickness, cold sweat--miserable and in pain. I've also learned that I have to leave it at home, or else I'll get the urge to pop them like candy if I take them with me for the day.

At this point I'm seriously considered what is more important to me.

Everything stopped burning and i ended up taking the maximuin dosage cause it would stop working as good as it first did. All of a sudden i was swollen all over, specialy my legs was tight as can get without splitting open and the rest of me joined in the swelling as well. I was and still am in a wheelchair and had limited range of movement but swollen i could barley transfer.  
 
I got the munchies and started calling it my little pot pill. It made me happy and giggly and i didnt hurt half as bad on it. 
 
The down side is you eventualy get unhappy. i gained a 100lbs fast from all the munchies specialy the sweets. Seemed like i couldnt get enough sugar. Thank God i wasnt diabetic. Giving this to diabetics would be cruelty in my opinion. 
 
I had to go off of it from all the swelling. i looked and felt like a hippo. Being in a wheelchair and gaining wieght is horrid cause you got no way to get it off other then starving yourself. But you cant do that cause you got meds you have to take with food. I know take gababentin  at high dose. there is no generic for lyrica and gabapebtin is the closest runner up. it helps me keep going without it i wouldnt ever move and would probably go off the deep end from all the pain. Its not as good as lyrica but the side effects are a big diffrence and it does help the pain a lot. Im not pain free but can cope with it now and suck it up. Nothing will make you pain free but if you can manage a degree of pain you know your alive and you also dont need something  covering up all of the pain anyway or you wont be able to tell when you may have a very bad problem with something else becoming a problem like apendics hurting, or chest pains, etc. some things you need to know and feel thats needing atention before you almost die from them or need 911.

I had pain relief after the first night, taking lyrica the night before.  Woke up with much less stiffness, and overall pain.  While sleeping I had much less pain caused by sleeping on 1 side.  Usually a very bruised and burning pain occurs as well as stiffness and I have to change position.  Which is painfull also.  Then when that position does the same thing have to turn again.  This seems to be eliminated.  My energy is 100% improved as well as my pain level being decreased considerably.  No major side effects, maybe additional unbalanced sensation.  No high, or vision issues.  Trying to drink more and going to keep an eye on weight issues.  But so far I think this medication is a God send.  I have taken narcotics and muscle relaxants.  Nothing has given any real relief.  This stuff is almost like a miracle.  NO  LIE.  If you seem sensitive to medication I would always be wary of anything that states you have to taper off it.

45-54,"Disorder characterized by Stiff, Tender & Painful Muscles",02-12-2010,lyrica,93965,5,5,"Works better for the pain of Fibromyalgia than narcotics and certainly better than Cymbalta. Yes, it has its downside. Weight gain, blurry vision, edema of the extremities. To me it's a trade-off. I'll take the side effects as they are easier to deal with than the unrelenting pain. This even helps with sleep issues common in Fibro patients as it does tend to make people feel a bit drowsy at first. That side effect helped me get into a normal sleep pattern as I was finally able to actually sleep thru the night.

I keep seeing patients repeating on here that this med makes one feel strange; memory issues, feeling like they are under the influence, feeling stupid, etc...that does happen pretty often according to my doctors, but you have to give it a chance and work through it for about a month. I felt the same and even told my PCP that I didn't know if I could continue the med. He begged me to stick it out for at least a month as the side effects tend to subside after that. I must say he was right. I'm also on 10mg hydrocodone, 4 times per day because of severe osteoarthritis and when I started taking that, it was the same deal. I felt under the influence, but that went away within a week after starting it. Now I just feel normal, not drunk or high. My rheumatologist (sp?) just increased my dose of Lyrica to the max for Fibro and that drunk feeling came back again, but this time I knew it would go away after awhile, and it did. 

For me, the hydrocodone/Lyrica combination has helped more than any other medication regimen for my Osteo arthritis/Fibromyalgia pain. Your mileage may vary.  ",4,Female,"Drowsiness,  dizziness ,  dry mouth ,  constipation , difficulty concentrating, or  weight  gain may occur.",3

Once in a while my heart would start pounding.  It wasn't until 7pm that I was able to put the thought ""maybe I should call someone"" together.  By that time I was staggering and stumbling.  I went to ER.  I had blood work, EKG and CAT scan.  The doctor felt it was an adverse reaction to one of my psych meds.  He didn't specifically say which one.  He told me to stop them for 48 hrs and then go back to original dose.  I will call my doctor this morning and see what he says.  I was totally wasted on it. I'm 59 yrs old and it has been a long time since my last buzz but it felt the same.  I love Lyrica.  When I started on it I was in so much Fibro and Myofascial pain I could barely move because I hurt so much.  I quit college before I got on it because of the pain, depression from the pain and exhaustion.  
There were little things I didn't pay attention too, nausea,comes and goes but it was more intense, occasional muscle spasms, confusion now and then etc.  
I hope the doctor can figure something out.  I would live with the pain but I don't know for how long, it was that bad

I have tried injections, chiropractic, accupuncture, tens unit, numerous physical therapy clinics, had a hysterectomy due to endometriosis, and more drugs than I can remember.  

I am on 7.5-325 Percoet 6x/day for the past 2 years, with Ultram ER for the breakthrough pain, and Flexeril at night to get me through the night without waking up in pain.  Even with that, the pain has been unbearable at times.  I am now on 150mg of Lyrica 2x/day.  I take it about an hour after waking, and normally just before bed.  I have recently changed the night time dose to earlier in the evening to give me more pain relief while awake.  I have to say that although I suffered significant side-effects in the beginning, I hung in there and now view Lyrica as a REAL HELP with my pain.  I had it all; swelling of the fingers and ankles, a bit of weight gain, and worst of all - a drunk feeling and the inability to concentrate.  

I have been on Lyrica for almost 3 months now.  The swelling and weigh gain has decreased significantly, and the drunk/dizzy feeling has dramatically reduced.  I still have a hard time concentrating at times, but overall Lyrica has really helped in reducing my pain.  

I have learned a little ""trick"" with using Lyrica in conjunction with Percocet.  Take the Percocet BEFORE the Lyrica (about an hour).  This helps a LOT with eliminating the drunk feeling.  

If you are new to Lyrica - HANG IN THERE.  Give it a REAL chance, not just a couple of weeks.

It went on and it is a good thing I am retired as if I am seen walking, you would think I was drunk.  I can turn my head and because I have diabetic Lower Limb Neuropathy and have no feeling in my feet at all and with the lost of balance because of being dizzy, I would almost fall down, but reacted fast enough to catch myself.

My appetite the first several days was normal but all of a sudden even after I lost my concern with weight gain while taking it, it was furious and I could not eat enough RED Meat especially.

Even though I have stage 4 Merkel Cell Carcinoma and the last tumor is near my spine and if it penetrates there I can have a lot of these same kinds of symptoms, less the apatite, I cannot imaging not taking Lyrica NOW.  

You see if I go back to what it was, I would be going back to the pain I had without it AND  I was on 2 5omg Tramadol, 3 -4 times a day PRN and 2 10 mg x 325 mg NORCO Opiates to relieve that pain it was so bad and nothing else would work.  I was fortunate to stop the Norco and I did it the first week after stopping and I did it immediately. I still take Tramadol PRN but remember too, I am a stage 4 cancer patient who is not on any type of Chemo yet and will be exposed to high end radiation soon and after the test are complete to help to know where to do that.  In any case, if the dizziness and drunk feelings would be taken away, you would have a wonder drug as far as I am concerned.  AND, FYI TOO - I was on Gabapentin Generic when I was a VA Patient for this and even though Lyrica is supposed to be like or the same as that drug, ALL it did for me was almost get me divorced.  I became a very hard person to deal with according to my wife and it started after that med from the VA.

Even narcotic painkillers did very little to ease my pain. Literally on a whim, my neurologist decided to try me on Lyrica for no other reason than he had just received samples of the then new medication. Initially I experienced many of the symptoms others described and I definately got a ""high"" from this medication, but that went away after 10-14 days. I have now been on it for 4 years and have had great success with it as it has allowed me to once again lead a productive life, something that had been missing for years. I am now on 600mg./day and overall am very satisfied with it. I do worry about any long term effects from taking it, but based on my quality of life or lack thereof prior to Lyrica, it is a risk I'm willing to take. Lyrica has made a very positive difference in my life and overall I am very pleased with it. The only downside for me is the price, it is a very expensive medication running $400/month with insurance paying 80%, hopefully a generic will be available soon.",4,Male,"Drowsiness,  dizziness ,  dry mouth ,  constipation , difficulty concentrating, or  weight  gain may occur.",24

I wonder if some of the bad side affects from some of the previous posters might be, because they were started on to high of a dosage.  

I have had no side affects at all. Or atleast none I have noticed. 
I would reccomend this medicine to any one.  JUst make sure you aren't put on such a high dosage that it scares you.

NEVER be afraid to talk to your Dr about dosage.

Also.   The internet is absolutely fantastic to look up some of the medicines that are perscribed to you.   Look it up and make an informed decision. 

The only reason I put 4 stars up for Ease of Use is because for me it is hard to remember the noon time dose.  I am usually running around at that time.  I forget. LOL

I knew from past experience with other medications that side effects come-n-go...when I first started Lyrica, I was freaked out at how many hit me at once, and was especially upset about the weight gain as ""almost overnight"" nothing fit me anymore, and it all centered in the belly, looking like I was pregnant.  All the effects were grossly disturbing to me, but the pain relief was so outstanding that I had to keep reminding myself that ""this too shall pass"" and now it is starting to.  I know that is very hard to do when so many side effects are hitting you at once, which seems to be what a lot of you are experiencing, but if you can hang in there I assure you they will subside.  When my weight packed on, I immediately went on an 800-calorie diet (not healthy, but I was desperate) and because my pain was taken care of, I exercised and swam like crazy.  Not ONE pound came off after a month of this, which made me ultra-frustrated and wanting to quit Lyrica ""right now"".  But I made myself remember how I could never have even gotten into a pool, let alone swim, in the last 10 years and this has allowed me to jump around like a monkey if I want to!  So I made myself BIG signs that I posted around my house that said ""Remember your pain"" and that helped me to focus on the good Lyrica was doing.  Now, going into my 4th month, life is great and with going back to a normal diet (but I still exercise gently), I feel wonderful.

I feel like a zombie with difficulty focusing, but at the same time twitchy, shaky, and fidgety. I have extreme dry mouth and thirst. I wake up at night having to pee at least 5 times, and that's with having had no liquids for at least three hours before bed. It gave me headaches and bad stomach aches. I discovered that if you have any caffeine (I drank a Diet Dr. Pepper) while on this medication, the side effects pretty much triple. I thought I would pass out because I became so shaky and light headed. It has also increased muscle tension, which has made the pain in my shoulders and neck worse. Lastly, even with lots of exercise and eating two meals of Special K, I am gaining weight and not being able to take it off. I have an extremely high metabolism and have previously always been able to immediately drop 5 pounds when wanted with very little effort. 

Do keep in mind that I've only been taking this for two weeks, so I don't know how many of these symptoms would even out.  However, in my opinion, the medication wasn't in the least effective. (I should also note that I have tried SSRI's and not been able to handle the side effects of those either.)

Unfortunately, it also made my hair fall out! Within one week after I started taking Lyrica, my hair started falling out in handfulls (wet or dry). Within a week and a half, my head was covered with Bald Patches.

I informed my Dr. of this, and she was not at all concerned.  So, I took it upon myself, to discontinue the Lyrica.  Within a few days after stopping the Lyrica, my hair stopped falling out.

This problem is not listed in any of the side affects for Lyrica, and it should be!
(8 mos. later, my Bald Patches have grown enough hair to at least hide them). But, if I hadn't gone off Lyrica when I did, I would have been completely Bald.

I just wanted to pass on my experience with Lyrica, before all the Fibromyalgia Patients out there jump on the Lyrica Band Wagon, and alot of people end up Bald because of this side effect, not mentioned by the Pharmacuetical Company.

As a person who had uncontrolled anxiety in the past, I know what it is like to freak out and imagine all sorts of problems when taking a new medication.  Heart racing, stomach pain, flushed face, trouble sleeping - these things could all be caused by anxiety or other things, so don't always believe that they are caused by the drug itself.

I have spoken to several patients, both women and me , and their experience was similar to mine. NO ONE should take Lyrica. It should be banned by the FDA.

It took years to get to a diagnosis and when I finally did the nurse practitioner put me on Lyrica and muscle relaxers and anti-inflammatories.....for the past few months that I have been on it it has been a God-send, but it looks as though all that new found hope has come to a screeching hault.  I have been having severe swelling of the extremities and sever pain in my legs because of that.  I am afraid that I am probably going to have to go off the medication :(  It is in fact a great medication if you are lucky enough not to have this side effect, and if you do have it and can tolerate it I would just wear flip flops and deal with the swelling if there is no pain because the medication truly does almost completely eliminate the pain....this is why I am very sad to think of going off this medication as I would cry myself to sleep for most every night for the months prior to receiving medication.  I`m thinking of possibly looking for a clinical trial of another medication but I don`t want to go on any anti-depressants as I am already taking them for depression and anxiety.  Another great thing about lyrica is that it will pretty much take away all of the fatigue you have been feeling....for me it`s a toss-up, but i`m afraid i`m going to have to go back to nothing or try some other medication if available.  I know it is such a terrible illness to have so for those of you who have it hang in there....hopefully one day we`ll find a cure.",3,Female,"Drowsiness,  dizziness ,  dry mouth ,  constipation , difficulty concentrating, or  weight  gain may occur.",15

Thank you all for sharing your experiences and trials with fibro. I was diagnosed with fibro, degenerative disc disease, cervical osteoarthritis, TMJ, chronic insomnia and now depression.  I have a problem dealing with stress and I think the stress has a lot to do with pain and tension. I have been on Effexor, Cymbalta, Klonapin, Lunesta, and steriods with little to no relief. I take Vicoprofin for pain when it is unbearable. Another drug I use as needed is Meprobamate - it is an older drug - a tranquilizer - which takes the edge off of stress. Right now, on a daily basis, I'm only taking Ativan for sleep and Citrical for osteopenia. I tried the Lyrica 50 mg at bedtime for 3 weeks. At first I was hopeful that the Lyrica was reducing the pain a little bit and since it was the lowest dose, I figured my rheumatologist would increase the dosage at my next appt. After this short time, Lyrica gave me side effects of headaches, stiff neck, flushed face, abdominal pain, trouble focusing, and weight gain (5 lbs. in 3 weeks). Also, it decreased my libido which was the reason I stopped taking Cymbalta. I did sleep better using it along with the Ativan. I have an appt. with a neuro-psychologist who has had success treating patients with chronic insomnia. I'm not sure if it is bio-feedback or what. I hope getting help with dealing with stress will help. I'll post again to let you know the results. I'd love to get off the daily drugs and just find a drug to use ""as needed."" I'm sure I'm not alone in being concerned with what all of these drugs will eventually do to our bodies after years and years. I'm also joining the Y so I can start swimming.

Tried Lyrica after several other ""pain"" medications failed due to side effects (duloxetine etc.).  Worked up to a dose of 225 slowly.  Had been taking the 75 portion in the morning and then the 150 at night but switched to taking the full dose at night because I was stumbling around in a semi-dream like state.  It still takes me a little longer to wake up (that drugged feeling) but OMGoodness!  I actually Sleep!!!  Not that half awake thing where I get up more exhausted than I was before I climbed into bed.  And sometimes I dream!  Whooo Hooo!  I have been on Lyrica for almost four years now.  I had a doctor that was up on things early.  I am lucky that I have had no real weight gain.  I do have blurry vision at times though but it is not a constant thing.  Also I have developed a slight leakage from my bladder after urination within the last six months or so.  However, this medication has been a godsend for me.  I am getting my life back again.  I am even planning on going back to work.  I still have some of the pain (occasional neck, elbows, ankles, fingers and hip/spine joint) but it is much less severe then before taking Lyrica. I would not want anyone to take this medication away from me.  Even with the blurry eyes and leaky bladder.  They are right about not drinking with this medication though -- keep that to a minimum.  I had severe projectile vomiting when I overdid it once.  Oh about that leaky  bladder, I just use a regular pantyliner.  It is not a lot.  Saw the urologist and she said that sometimes this happens.  I have had no children and my muscles there seem to be fine.  Thoughts are that I just get my bladder too full at times now that I do not need to go as often and have overstressed it.

I started taking Lyrica about 3 weeks ago for my Fibromyalgia. My doctor told me to start on 50mg for a duration of 2 weeks, and then increase it to 100mg to start off slowly. During the first 2 weeks of taking Lyrica, I noticed some changes in myself: trouble with my memory, consentration, and just speaking in general. I would also become horribly dizzy after I'd take my pill each night. 
After I began taking the 100mg, I noticed a big change in my mental state. I still had the side effects listed above and new ones: I would cry over every little thing, and I could not make a decision for even the smallest task.
My doctor instructed me to stop taking Lyrica because of how much it was altering my mental state. Now I am dealing with the side effects of stopping Lyrica: trouble urinating, dizzyness, and fatigue.
I have had a very bad experience with Lyrica, but that is just my story. It is one of the best drugs out there for Fibromyalgia and I suggest that you try it before you make a decision whether to take it or not. My story is sort of a warning for whoever reads this, because I did not think the medication would effect my mind as my as it did.

I'm young, a college student, and PHN can be very debilitating. I've suffered with PHN for FOUR years now and the pain is still excruciating. 

Lyrica was probably the worst thing I could've taken. I took it because there was a change in my mood. But the side effects were absolutely horrible. I felt high, had trouble concentrating, memory loss, horrible weight gain, and unbearable shooting pains throughout my body if I missed a dose. 
I would never recommend this medication to anyone. The only reason I was on it for so long was because I did notice a calmer change in my mood. As did the people around me. Though, it didn't help the pain at all. Lyrica is a joke.

I recently stopped taking Lyrica. Cutting down the dosages. And I have horrible shooting pains through my body that I never had before. Now I have to deal with this on top of the PHN.

I had the same experience with doctors...in the past they look at you like you have three heads or flat out tell you it is all in your mind and you need more exercise, which can be difficult with fibro. 

That being said, when my doctor first told me about Lyrica I did not even ask about the side effects because I finally felt valitated and agreed to start taking it right away.  The doctor gave me a sample for 1 wk and then I went to fill the RX. 1st problem, my Blue Shield insurance would not cover it until I tried 3 other medications, even though this is the only one FDA approved for Fibromyalgia.  So I paid for the the very expensive prescription, as I was feeling much better even with only taking the samples for 1 wk.  

Fast forward to 6 weeks later....my vision has become terrible, my balance has gotten worse and I have gained almost 20 pounds in 6 weeks.  I can wear most of my shoes and my wedding ring of 25 years no longer fits on my hand.  

I have decided the side effects are not worth the relief from the pain.  I stopped three days ago, but now I have had a terrible headache for 2 days. I was only taking 75mg at bedtime, as I could not take in the morning and drive to work due to the cognitive disfunction and sleepness.

House shoes have been my style for awhile now. Second symptom: into the third and fourth months my hands were so big (and this is all the time on and off, not just am) Rings had to be cut off.  My eyes have given me issues, different issues since the first month, blurred and double - that has been bad. There are some weird side effects, but until Yesterday I thought they were worth it.

For starters, was on Lyrica 50mg 3xâ€™s /day for 2-3 months for chronic and debilitating bilateral hand pain/recurrent carpal tunnel syndrome of 7+ years, with the right hand being worse then the left.(I am right handed)  Concurrent meds for 7+ years are Ultram, Soma & Lidocaine patch.  In the past have tried several meds under several MDâ€™s for condition.  The latest attempt was the Lyrica.  During the trial my left hand pain cleared up almost completely and the right hand by about 60%(depending on usage.)  But, at the same time I started noticing a slight weight gain.  I work out 1-2 hours a day, 5-6 days a week and lead a low fat, meat free diet.  Oh, and Iâ€™m also a 47 y/o female who had a vaginal hysterectomy last year.  About a month into the med I noticed that I no longer felt sated after eating.  My PCP thought it was diet related, so I increased my calories at each meal to binge levels,2000 or more,(my usual daily intake is 1350-1450 a day.)  This didnâ€™t help at all.  Then I noticed that I also wasnâ€™t feeling hunger.  I could go all day without eating and not feel hunger.  I still felt the need to eat, my brain told me like clockwork at mealtimes that I was craving this or that, but if I stopped for a minute I realized there was absolutely no feeling in the stomach, not even a growl.  At the same time I started having problems riding in a car.  I would get very dizzy and nauseated.  After discussing it with the PCP I cut the dosage down to 2xday.  The dizziness cleared a little, the hand pain came back a little.  Then I cut the dose down to 1x/day.  The dizziness was mostly gone, the hand pain got stronger, and I started to feel slight twinges of hunger.  Iâ€™m now 2Â½ weeks completely off the med and rode in a car with just slight nausea, and yesterday I felt full after my dinner of apx 500 calories.

As you can image these falls have taken me away from work and have been rather embarrassing, since I am not one to typically lose my balance.

So with the lowest dose 150mg. 1st week was a disaster, my hands & feet/ankels were so swollen I could not wear my sneakers. Wore my house shoes everywhere. I knew this was a minor side effect that would go away. I also was constantly hungry, even after I would eat my appetite never seemed satisfied. So of course the 2nd week came & dosage was increased to 300mg, I took it at bedtime since it would make me extremely drowsy. *The one good point so far*
I also noticed that I would be staring off like in a dreaming state it was weird & then my vision would get a little blurry sometimes. I also nodded off while driving..I never done that on any other meds. This was to scary, I called Doc she said to try to stick it out. Now while all this was going on, I was not getting ANY type of pain relief. I know FMS cannot be cured with any one med, but Lyrica was causing me more symptoms than anything positive could have made me overlook.
I continued with the meds for nearly 4 months...and in the end....it had me gain almost 15lbs YES that much in 4 months. And I remained active, my diet actually was redone to help me improve my irritable bowel I had started getting more problems with due to Lyrica...so all in all...FOR ME this medication was just a big waste of time, weight gain & swollen hands & feet were a pain in my you know what.

The secret to not hurting with Fibro is getting into the 3rd and 4th stages of sleep. If your body is in pain while you sleep you will not reach 3 & 4 sleep levels in which your muscles relax .Without them relaxing you will hurt every day you do not let them sleep. I promise you this works.I have had Fibro for 7 years from a horse accident and lst you have to rest at night and let your muscles go OFF DUTY and you will feel like a new person in a few days.I NEVER go to bed without a sleep aide. I am on Ambien and my muscles say thank you every day I can play in my flowers and yard and spend time living instead of sitting in a chair while my muscles die from not using them. I go to the gym and walk and ride a bike slowly not to hurt my muscles.Remember to keep your muscles warm and not get chilled. I use to use a heating blanket at night and it helped me so much. Get rest and try to use your muscles everyday so you do not lose them.I take 50mg of Lyricia and 100mg at night.I feel so good like I never had Fibromyalgia.

However, I do find it amazing at how many people have complained about this medication on here and blamed it for their lack of attention to detail. I have worked at a pharmacy and can tell you that everyone handles medications in different ways. On any OTC medication you should always look closely at the ingredients and make sure that they are not something you are allergic to or been known to have a bead reaction to previously. As with any medication you need to make sure you both understand and follow the directions carefully on how to take it. 

Pyrilamine Maleate is both a diuretic and antihistamine. If you are already taking medications that have those properties then your reactions will be more severe. If you are allergic to those types of medications then don't take them.

If in doubt, ask the pharmacist about the medications and what they do. If you tell them what your conditions are and what medications you're already on, then they will give all the information you need to know whether or not to take it.

Midol has been in production for many years and I definitely have never had any issues with it. I am also on heavy pain medications and mental illness medications. When I asked my pharmacist about the medication, she told me to only take up to 4 a day and no more because I'm already on an antihistamine and Acetaminophen.

- if you get diarrhea then eat a small portion of rice with nothing else the first couple of days
- take Prilosec or equivalent 1hr before meal (6:30AM & 4:30PM)
- take Pylera right after meal (7:30AM/12:30PM/5:30PM/10:30PM)
- have an early dinner 5:30PM so it's far enough from the 4th dose
- do not exercise/low activity all day as much as possible
- lay down on your back as little as possible
- do not sleep right after taking the last dose, stay standing or light walk i.e. sleep after 30mins at least
- avoid sleeping fully flat on your back i.e. put some pillows so your back is inclined (it's not easy but it pays off)
- spit often (yes I know...)

I switched to taking it at night time and those symptoms went away. Although, I do have sleeping problems now. But nothing that a Benadryl doesn't help with.

13-18,Birth Control,01-08-2016,low-ogestrel,17509,5,5,I got put on low ogestrel by my previous obgyn and was overall very satisfied with it. I don't remember having any negative side effects when I first started taking it after being off birth control for a few months and the only reason I have just recently switched is that the estrogen was so high it was blocking my testosterone receptors and making it impossible for me to get wet even when I was turned on. Sex has been fairly painful even with lube. I'm switching to lutera which is a similar birth control but with less estrogen in it. Also on low ogestrel my skin has been perfectly clear to the point where I hardly use my dermatologist prescribed stuff anymore. Overall very good birth control if you can handle the estrogen.

My cycle had become a little less predictable as well, though that could just be age-related (I'm nearly 40). I've been taking the Ogestrel for one cycle now, so not really long enough to say if it's truly effective. Less spotting so far and milder ovarian pain. But the side effects are killing me. I was nauseous almost immediately, to the point where I had to abruptly cut short a trip to the grocery store because I thought I was going to be sick. I switched to taking it at night which seemed to help. I've always had problems with acne but it has gotten significantly worse since I started the Ogestrel. And it's negatively affecting my mood as well; I'm more irritable, sometimes depressed and generally moodier, all things that weren't present before taking it. I'm trying to give it at least another cycle before I throw in the towel but at this point, I'd rather deal with the ovarian cysts than these side effects.",2,Female,"Nausea ,  vomiting ,  headache ,  bloating ,  breast  tenderness, swelling of the  ankles /feet (fluid retention), or  weight  change may occur.",1

The worst I've EVER felt. I'd break down and sob and feel hopeless/worthless, then angry and confused the next--emotionally out of control. It's really affected my schoolwork and relationships. I've have some outside stressors that are influencing my depressive state, but I had no idea this medicine could be a major component. After a couple of major emotional breakdowns I've decided to contact my doctor to see about either switching back to Yaz or some other birth control.

It's just the medication.  Now maybe it won't bother me so much.  I have been on this pill for several years.  Initially, I was placed on it because I started having difficult cramps with another med.  The cramping didn't really get better, but I think in my case this may be simply due to age or time I've been on the pills.  When I was younger (about ages 17-28) I barely experienced cramps at all.  I made a decision on my own about 2 years ago to get off the pill simply to give my body a break (because of the cramping and the fact that I had been on BC for about 15 years straight).  My doctor didn't recommend this, but I felt personally it was what we best, and used condoms during this time.  About 6 months ago, because of a new relationship, I decided to go back on the pill.  This nearly coincided with some other upper-abdominal issues I've been having for about a year.  And my doctor decided to start having me take the pill continuously (i.e. on a 3-week cycle, skipping the placebo pills and starting another pack right away). The reason for this was because my dr thought one possibility for my stomach pain could be endometreosis and by taking the pill this way it would suppress my periods, and the pain.  That has been successful.  I personally don't like the idea of not getting a period and I believe my issues to be due to something else besides endometreosis, so I plan to see a different specialist and find out the root cause of my pain/bloating.  This way I can take the pill the regular 28-day way. 
But, I will say that I have had very good success with this pill (for both contraception and possible endometreosis).  I definitely would recommend it over other meds.  The emotional downs are a side-effect that I can get past, based on the other positive factors of this pill.

Switched from lo-estrine 24 fe because i kept getting breakthrough bleeding that would last for up to two weeks until my next period. This happened twice in the span of under 6 months AFTER i had been on it for over a year. Did some research and discovered that i could be having breakthrough bleeding because my body had gotten used to the hormone levels because they were so low. Loestrine is the lowest dose on the market at this time. I use the pill in combination with a condom 95% of the time so pregnancy isnt a big concern for me because i take the pill every day. But the research i did told me that the hormone levels that fluctuate throughout my cycle were causing my uterine lining to come off too soln in the month but because i was taking the pill still it was only a light amount because i was still getting the hormone but it just wasnt enough. I have yet to have a period on this pill so i dont know how long it will last. Loestrine started on a friday (for sunday starters) and ended on a tuesday. That was with 4 placebo pills. So ill leave another update when i know more. Also, i do have bipolar spectrum disorder and im further down the spectrum than most people are. I have not had any issues with suicidal thoughts or mood swings that i could not attribute to my disorder. That was with both pills so far. I have access to an anti anxiety medicine too for my generalized anxiety disorder and medicine for my bipolar disorder. Im also on a thyroid medicine for a low functioning thyroid.

I love it(unfortunately I have to switch to generic version of loestrin 24 due to outrageous price brand name) I didn't realize how crazy and bad everything was because of the birth control until I switched.

So far so good I'm really on a schedule now. I actually ran errands after eating the other day I would NEVER have been able to eat and then go somewhere.

It is now available in generic so I pay $15 a month with insurance. Don't know what I would do if they don't cover it. Can't imagine life without this now. If you are worried then read the medical reviews (studies/trials) since it was rereleased there have been no deaths or horrible incidents. Go slow and don't get discouraged it takes some time to adjust and see how much you need.

I had already told my husband to go on with his life.  I felt like I needed to be confined to my home at the age of 42.  It caused some depression because I am a very active person and felt like I needed a portable potty with me at all times. Well since I have been taking lotronex I have had no side effects and I am living Life to the fullest.  I went online and got the number for the drug co and they sent me discount cards so the medication for a 60 month supply only cost me a $15 copay. I take 1 0.5mg twice a day. I only take the evening one if I am going to be out somewhere were I might get alittle squeezy. It is WONDERFUL!  I was alittle nervous at the beginning to start it because of the side effects and waiver I had to sign but I am glad God is with me on this one!  it's the best.  You can also call the company and get them to send you a card for a 2 week trial at no cost.  You just need a RX from your dr for #30 and take it to the pharmacy with the card. Now the other discount cards you can use each card 6 times for refills.  GOOD LUCK!  Thank God for Lotronex! ,5,Female, ,22

(took 18 days to dissolve clot)

WARNING WARNING WARNING
i wish i had a heads up before taking this drug to maybe mentally prepare myself. the needle itself is nothing, it super tiny and doesnt hurt at all going in. so thats not the problem. as soon as the med goes in its the worst burning sensation ever, like a 100 wasps stinging you and if you can imagine your skin tearing. thats what it feels like. an Indian burn that is ripping your skin open. the burning stays in a space about the size of a quarter for the first 20 minutes,then progressively spreads (the burning) to about the size of a small plate. then the whole area burns and is VERY sensitive to the touch or if you move that area for the next 2 or so hours. the next day or two an area about the size of your fist turns into a bruise that hurts if you move it or touch it. i had to inject my stomach and thighs so when i would walk or bend over or even having a shirt touch my skin was painful. after about a month i was running out of spaces to inject and had to inject on the bruising to be expected it was the same feelings of pain just 3489273827 times worse.

there were times where i skipped a dose KNOWING this med was saving my life. it was so painful and made me so depressed. i would count down and dread the time i was to get it and then would lay immobile for the following 2 hours to reduce pain. between worrying and laying down it literally took up my entire day.

i have no history of health problems but the drs said if i get pregnant again i have to go on it bc its the only one safe for pregnancy. bc of this i am choosing not to have anymore kids. this is the only reason. it was THAT bad.

Taking w/ Tobramycin, Prolensa

Side effects of meds: Eye spasms. Burning. Digestive upset/ Crohn's Disease aggravation requiring treatment. Dry mouth/nose. Severe daily headaches for duration of treatment.

Dr. praised me for having least problems for that week, I'm sure due to appropriate post-op treatment with meds. 

Eye spasme/twitching has been ongoing for a month, even after discontinuation of meds. Hoping will continue to improve, but could be exacerbation of my dystonia, and could be permanent.

Cataracts were functionally blinding me, so am glad for the surgery, but wish there were better options for my post-op care. 

Have a history of severe and disabling chronic Migraine and other severe headche disorders; 
Crohn's disease; lupus; Sjogren's disease; thyroid disease; hyperparathyroidism; dystonia; osteoporosis; avascular necrosis; other problems.

Drops were difficult to take since I couldn't initially see to ""aim"" and have severe shoulder problems due to AVN. Drops were hard to coax from bottle, and I ran out due to missing my eyes on so many occasions. 

Headaches were nearly severe enough for emergency room visits, and was in constant and severe pain for the duration of treatment, however; headache pain resumed to normal within 36 hrs of the end of treatment.

Digestive problems were fairly severe, and I was afraid I may have to stop treatment due to the danger to my gut, and endanger my eyesight. Was prescribed a special med to help with NSAID side effects and was able to continue treatment, although just barely.

Given the option, I would do the surgery and take the meds, but I wish I would have been better prepared for the side effects of meds that seemed so friendly. I would purchase something to help me get the drops in my eye.

I do notice that I am lower on energy, but over all I feel fine. It has reduced my anxiety and I do occassionally experience vertigo if I am up to 6 hours late taking it.

I also experienced vertigo often with the buildup. I do have a dry cough that is not bothersome, and gets more intense if I forget to take it.

Dr. Q never checked me out at all, relied on the doctor notes of a former physician or those physicians that I saw at the hospital and also spent approx. 5-8 mins with me, ending off with an ""everything looks good"",till one day I had a bad case of food poisioning from tainted fruit. I was not feeling well at all. My family took me to the doctors office and Dr.Q admitted me to the hospital.

Since I left the hospital, I thought the symptoms that I was having from this was just me until my daughter happen upon this site.

I feel very light-headed where I move and talk extremely slow and 85% of my day is spent in bed because I cannot function the way I normally function. I live an independant, lively, engergetic, agressive, competitive lifestyle, that I want back not only for me but for my family as well. Needless to say, I insisted for him to take me off it and to put me back on my orignal bp medicine. He refused to put me back on and insisted that I follow his orders or find another physician and since the time Dr.Q made that comment he had already released me from his care leaving me to find someone else.

Yesterday 9/1/2012 was my first day using and only instilled 3x's since I filled the Rx in late afternoon. When I woke in the morning my left eyelid was swelled so bad and I am wondering if this is a sign that the meds are working?  The left eyelid is the one suffering more severely with GPC, the right lid just had the normal puffiness that I've been experiencing, so I would expect that if I was allergic to this med, that both lids would have swelled the same.  I've also been prescribed Patanol which was started on 8/27/2012 - instill 2x's daily and was told to continue with both meds to try and knock this out. I've instilled the Patanol to see if it would take the swelling down since it is an antihistimine-after about 20 mins it appears to have helped a bit. I am going to wait another hr or so to see if the swelling subsides before taking the Lotemax. My GPC was diagnosed on 8/27/12, however I suspect this started about 4 wks prior to that and was initially prescribed Vigamox to treat pink-eye. It wasn't until 8/27 that the Dr flipped my eyelid to discover GPC was present. My vision remains unaffected through all this, the eyelids are the main issue with swelling and itchiness. Discharge is minimal.  I've discontinued using my contacts since 8/27. This is my first episode ever with GPC. I will update on my progress with Lotemax - however, so far, not impressed - I guess I was hoping for an overnight miracle instead of a left eyelid almost swelled shut.

Taking w/ Tobramycin, Prolensa

Side effects of meds: Eye spasms. Burning. Digestive upset/ Crohn's Disease aggravation requiring treatment. Dry mouth/nose. Severe daily headaches for duration of treatment.

Dr. praised me for having least problems for that week, I'm sure due to appropriate post-op treatment with meds. 

Eye spasme/twitching has been ongoing for a month, even after discontinuation of meds. Hoping will continue to improve, but could be exacerbation of my dystonia, and could be permanent.

Cataracts were functionally blinding me, so am glad for the surgery, but wish there were better options for my post-op care. 

Have a history of severe and disabling chronic Migraine and other severe headche disorders; 
Crohn's disease; lupus; Sjogren's disease; thyroid disease; hyperparathyroidism; dystonia; osteoporosis; avascular necrosis; other problems.

Drops were difficult to take since I couldn't initially see to ""aim"" and have severe shoulder problems due to AVN. Drops were hard to coax from bottle, and I ran out due to missing my eyes on so many occasions. 

Headaches were nearly severe enough for emergency room visits, and was in constant and severe pain for the duration of treatment, however; headache pain resumed to normal within 36 hrs of the end of treatment.

Digestive problems were fairly severe, and I was afraid I may have to stop treatment due to the danger to my gut, and endanger my eyesight. Was prescribed a special med to help with NSAID side effects and was able to continue treatment, although just barely.

Given the option, I would do the surgery and take the meds, but I wish I would have been better prepared for the side effects of meds that seemed so friendly. I would purchase something to help me get the drops in my eye.

The Lastacaft was to replace the Lotemax in attending to the inflammation. I also was prescribed Restasis and have been using 2x daily for the last 8 months. I no longer have the sore eyes I once had but I still suffer from red eyes. Anti-redness drops can only be used once a day and only address the redness for a short time.Lastacaft addresses itchy eyes but not the redness. Nothing else addresses the redness like Lotemax. I feel attractive again, unlike the self conscious feeling I would have from looking at people with these red, tired looking eyes. I am going to talk to my doctor again about using Lotemax with more regularity. I am reading such mixed reviews from doctors who are for and against using Lotemax regularly. If I can use Restasis and Lotemax daily , the answer to both the dryness and the redness are answered.",5,Female,Temporary  blurred vision  may occur when you apply this  medication .

Yesterday 9/1/2012 was my first day using and only instilled 3x's since I filled the Rx in late afternoon. When I woke in the morning my left eyelid was swelled so bad and I am wondering if this is a sign that the meds are working?  The left eyelid is the one suffering more severely with GPC, the right lid just had the normal puffiness that I've been experiencing, so I would expect that if I was allergic to this med, that both lids would have swelled the same.  I've also been prescribed Patanol which was started on 8/27/2012 - instill 2x's daily and was told to continue with both meds to try and knock this out. I've instilled the Patanol to see if it would take the swelling down since it is an antihistimine-after about 20 mins it appears to have helped a bit. I am going to wait another hr or so to see if the swelling subsides before taking the Lotemax. My GPC was diagnosed on 8/27/12, however I suspect this started about 4 wks prior to that and was initially prescribed Vigamox to treat pink-eye. It wasn't until 8/27 that the Dr flipped my eyelid to discover GPC was present. My vision remains unaffected through all this, the eyelids are the main issue with swelling and itchiness. Discharge is minimal.  I've discontinued using my contacts since 8/27. This is my first episode ever with GPC. I will update on my progress with Lotemax - however, so far, not impressed - I guess I was hoping for an overnight miracle instead of a left eyelid almost swelled shut.

I called my physician and she is placing me on another pill tonight, so I'm crossing my fingers. I've never experienced a pill that did these things to me.

What I don't like is that when I DO get my period on LoSeasonique, it lasts for about 8 days.  It is very, very light though.  I'll even spot for a few days after taking the active pills again.

Those two side effects were gone within two weeks and I now have no side effects at all. My pressure says low. Not sure yet how well it will mitigate my white coat response (it's likely I will still spike but maybe not as high as before). But I know that keeping my bp very low consistently will be protective. I am also encouraged by the neuroprotective benefits of losartan and other ARBs.

Beware of Blood Pressure Medication named LOSARTAN...PLEASE READ...

So, here is my 'unprofessional' opinion on why this happens to millions of people and why all doctors refuse to attribute any of these symptoms to the Losartan. 
I think that the acctual medicine is not what causes the symptoms per say. I strongly believe that it is the additives and impurities that are put into the medicine in the factories that produce it in China and Thailand that are acctually causing these symptoms.  The symptoms come on very slowly.  Usually about 3-6 weeks after starting the med. Meaning whatever chemical impurity  causing them builds in your system until you start to get the negative effects. The symptoms are similar across the board of millions of people taking this drug and  90% come from  the generic Losartan and not the brand name(Cozaar) because most people cannot afford brand name and insurance won't cover it. 
Very few people(10% or less) take the medicine that is the generic form and not have significant side effects. 
Or, they may have it and not attribute it to this medication because their doctor insists it is not the med. (Not realizing that it is the manufacturing plant and impurities added to it that is the true culprit) 
The symptoms across millions of people taking this medicine includes(people could develop one or more...)
Anxiety, 
 depression, 
 gastrointestinal issues,
 back pain, 
muscle pain, 
leg weakness,
 knee pain,
 hip pain, 
Diareah 
Headaches 
Neck pain
Dehydration 
Electrolyte imbalance
Tittunus

Nausea

Weight loss or Weight gain
Palpitations 
Heart flutters
Inability to walk

Excess phlegm
Nasal congestion

Short term, I have had no side effects from Loryna. No weight gain, no extreme mood swings, nothing. My only complaint and reason for considering switching is that after taking this long term, i recently developed spider veins on my thighs. I have NEVER had such a thing so it was very concerning as i am only 25 and in very good health, and as I know there are increased risks for DVT while taking this drug. Recently the areas on my thigh where the spider veins developed have become somewhat painful at work (as I stand all day). I attribute the development of the spider veins directly to Loryna as this is only medication I have taken the past couple years. It is such a shame because I absolutely love what it has done for my skin (flawless even during the time around my period), but the veins cause a large concern for me so I am heavily considering switching.

After every surgery my doctors changed the brand/hormones in an effort to suppress growth of Endometrosis.

Frankly, all of these pills have the same side effects for me and so I dealt with them - some had more bloating (patch, seasonale, tri-cyclen) others made me a little more moody (lo-estrin) and no sex drive to all of the above. The ring caused my pelvis to inflame and I felt the need to eat constantly (very strange for me). 

So, after my last surgery, my new doctor suggested LoSeasonique. 

I've had surgeries since age 18 and assumed she gave it to me because I have already been on everything else; but I find that I do like this pill. It really does seem different. After 6 weeks - no bloating, spotting, excess hunger or acne. Those things I had learned to live with weren't there anymore. So far, I am doing well and hope it will help prevent new Endo.
Cons:
It is new(ish) and is not always covered by insurance but it does have a savings program. 

When I switched to it from Mircette I did have some dreary moodiness which was already anticipated. But I've come out of that now.

I couldn't stand in one position for more than 10 minutes without doubling over in pain.  I started researching medications I was taking -- new to me was Lovastatin and Atenolol/Chlor.

I have mixed feelings about it but will continue to give it a try and hope the pill does what it should in the long run and give me lighter periods only 4x year. Prior to taking the pill, I was off BC for 6 years. My period would last 5 days and like clockwork, I knew when to expect it every 28 days. After I began the pill, I got an unusual long and heavy period. I bled heavily for 6 of the 10 days. My next period started 28 days later. I spotted for 3 days, had a medium flow for 2 days, spotted for 3, medium flow for 3 days and it stopped, total 11 days. Weird! Then 28 days later, spotting off and on for 5 days and I questioned whether I was having a period. Then medium flow for 4 days and 5 more days of spotting, total of 14 days. During the periods, I had cramps and nausea 1-2 times a day. I am curious what my period will be like when I am on the one week placebo pill. Doctor says all this is normal as my body adjusts to it. I still have a great desire for sex and hubby doesnâ€™t complain of sex while spotting. No additional weight gain or loss. My hormonal acne seems to have gone away!

I also have pain during intercourse, dryness, and low libido, which I have never struggled with before. I am not a cryer, but in the past months of taking this drug I randomly cry at commercials or have mood swings, which is bizarre because I am normally a chill person.

I couldn't stand in one position for more than 10 minutes without doubling over in pain.  I started researching medications I was taking -- new to me was Lovastatin and Atenolol/Chlor.  I decided perhaps the muscle problems were related to the new BP med -- perhaps potassium deficiency.  Started taking Klor-Con, but no improvement.  ""Accidentally"" heard the warning at the end of the T.V. commercial with Dr. Jarvik regarding muscle problems.  Finally talked to my (very trustworthy) pharmacist (who is also my boss -- I'm a pharmacy tech); he told me he'd personally rather risk having a stroke than take a statin drug!  Went off Lovastatin -- it took a full 2 months for the pain/discomfort to go away.  I'll risk high cholesterol rather than ever take another statin!

Luckily, I felt used to Loryna by the 2nd month. I'm 18 years old, about 110 lbs and 5'2"". When I talked to my doctor about birth control I told her that I didn't want to gain weight and I didn't want to experience break outs. She recommended Yaz, but because of my pharmacy or insurance (still not sure), I was given the generic version: Loryna. When I started, I experienced severe mood swings, I felt miserable, I was emotional, and I felt like it was affecting my relationship with my boyfriend. I wanted OFF. However, I stuck to it because of the ""3 month period"". I eventually came to get used to it, I wasn't as moody or emotional (but still more sensitive/cranky compared to when I wasn't on the pill). I still get periods for about 4 days, when I take the white pills, that's when I expect my period. I still get cramps like before I was on birth control. I see no difference in my skin (not better nor worse), I still get mild breakouts, usually around my time of the month. I feel like I may have gained about 5+ lbs, because I am around 115 lbs now, but I think it's mostly water weight.
When it comes to effectiveness, my boyfriend and I have always used ""the pullout"" method, and we're both very careful, but I got on the pill just to be sure. I was told Loryna was effective after a week, but I didn't allow my boyfriend to cum in me until I finished my first pack and started my second pack. All went well! I got my expected period!
I am a senior in high school and I take my pill everyday at 2pm, I keep a reminder on my phone. I have not missed a pill, and the latest I've been is around 2:45pm. I'm very good with my pill, so I expect it to be effective.
Overall, I think Loryna is good compared to most other birth controls. The only big difference is that I'm much more emotional.",4,Female,"Nausea ,  vomiting ,  headache ,  bloating ,  breast  tenderness, swelling of the  ankles /feet (fluid retention), or  weight  change may occur.",3

55-64,High Cholesterol,1/23/2008,"lovastatin tablet, extended release 24 hr",11594,5,1,I recently switched from Crestor to Lovastatin mostly due it's MUCH cheaper and i am on a fixed income. I was on Crestor for aprox 4 years. I noticed just 2 weeks into taking the Lovastatin that i was having severe muscle pain in my right upper arm. After 5 days of using medicated heat pads and massages i started questioning what had i done recently to have caused such pain. Then i realized the only thing i did different was switch my medication. Now my left arm is effected in the same muscle. I called the pharmacy that filled my perscription and they said to immediatly stop taking the Lovastatin. He said the musle pain should go away within a few days. I certainly hope so as this is VERY painful. ,1,Female, ,39

 ,Birth Control,10/20/2010,loseasonique,152006,5,2,"I started taking this BC on the first day of my period (Thursday), which was almost over 2 weeks ago. My last period only lasted 4 days, and my previous periods lasted no longer than 6 days. Since this is my first time on a BC, I didn't really know what to expect, but I knew something was off when I continued to spot with thick, dark discharge after my period ended. 

I tried to trooper through it by continuing to take it up until the Saturday after the first week. It is now Wednesday (a day shy of the two-week mark). The spotting stopped last night, but now I'm experiencing bright, liquidy discharge. I don't have a medical diploma to tout, but I know enough to say that this is not normal.

During the 1.5 weeks that I took the BC, I had constant cravings (mainly for sugary treats and meat), was agitated by inactivity, had shaky hands, could not sleep during the hours I would regularly go to bed. Before you mark me of as neurotic, I have to assert that I'm as easily stressed out as a pet rock. I'm about as mellow as a person can naturally be. 

In short, if taking a BC would put me under this much ... I don't even know what to call this... I would much rather not take it and go with the old-fashion route: using condoms and calculating the days of the month to have sex.",1,Female,"Nausea ,  vomiting ,  headache ,  bloating ,  breast  tenderness, swelling of the  ankles /feet (fluid retention), or  weight  change may occur.",5

I had been through several different pills suffering clinical migraines, heavy bleeding and constant nausea. Yaz seemed to be tailor-made for my body as I had no issues with it for the next 8 years, until it simply became too expensive and I switched to loryna.
17 days after the switch, I was hospitalized after waking up to the pain of a ruptured cyst. After spending about 5 years worth of yaz pills on my hospital bills, I decided that, perhaps because the cyst was quite large, it was already there and ruptured from the switch. However, for the next month and a half, I experienced bloating, dryness, spotting, excessive hair loss (but only on my scalp as I grew a few dark whiskers on my chin and my bikini line seemed to migrate down my legs at an alarming rate), and probably worst of all, I became reclusive and my mind would wander into very dark places! I wound up switching to Gianvi (which I have been on for about 7 months now), and my bikini line has thinned back out as well as my hair regaining its sheen and a new crop of baby hairs all over my scalp.
I apologize for the long post, but I only want to give you a full picture of my experience. Perhaps loryna may be alright for some ladies who want a contraceptive that will clear up their acne. I'm sure that if a hormonally healthy woman were to take it, things might be different. 
I have PCOS, so I don't make nearly enough of my own estrogen, making me a good candidate for this type of synthetic estrogen. If you have a similar problem, my experience leads me to suggest trying Gianvi first if you can't afford yaz. My Gynecologist said that loryna has inavtive ingredients that may cause a much quicker absorbtion in some women possibly causing spikes of high testosterone, even though the active ingredients are identical.

I have been weaning myself off this stuff, taking gabapentin(300mg X 3 a day). I want to get this drug out of my system as soon as possible! It's not for me.

We cut the dosage to two grams a day. Lab work done in February indicated that two liver enzynmes had increased to abnormal levels.

I used to take Yasmin for years (which was great) but I decided to switch and try something different because I hate getting periods!
From the other reviews I read on this website and others, it seems like the side affects of this pill are extreme, and overall no one seems very satisfied with it.  
I'm going to continue with this pill for another month or so and hopefully the spotting and bleeding will stop.  I personally have had no other problems with using loseasonique, but the daily bleeding (even though it is minimal) is becoming such an awful nuisance and really needs to stop!!
